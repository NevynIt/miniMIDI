todo:
- multibyte opcodes, pc points to the next instruction, remove all parameters to op_XX methods
  - adv and gather can update the mask, based on the next word, and can be immediate or not, these are independent
- chaining wave generators by filling buffers in sequence. use a ptr to the buffer of the previous wave, within the dsp buffers, but it has to wrap
  - instead, make ret a pointer, and fill updates the ret pointer as it goes
- implement custom stdio driver that somehow knows which channel is active at the moment
  - make the hw uart and usb uart go on the same core, so that a ptr can be changed when using the cli from them, so that answers go in the same place the request came from
  - better, check which core you are! core 0 prints, core 1 queues, core 0 prints all the queue in the preferred debug line once every cycle - requires defining a preferred line
- add file ops functions between stdlib and sd fatfs lib
- test lua, connect to cli and to serial
- rbj filter, params and refresh filter every x samples
- add a wrapper decorator for wrapping any wave and add asm support
- wave specific buffers ?
