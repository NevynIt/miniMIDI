todo:
- remove decorators and transform them into match classes like tolong<rule>
- separate lua and run startup script
- access the configuration memory
- rbj filter, params and refresh filter every x samples
- add a wrapper decorator for wrapping any wave and add asm support
- wave specific buffers ?
- test division in fpm.h

/*
The main objective of the datafile parser is to load a dynamic configuration file from the SD card and update the configuration of the device.
the lua script is called at the beginning, and it in turn calls a C function that takes a string in a custom language and returns
a byte array with the data. Lua also calls a C function that takes a name and an array and sets the configuration value.

in strings in the custom language, whitespace is ignored and comments are allowed with -- lik, and strings can be split into multiple lines with \ at the end of the line.
The custom language is as follows (in extended BNF notation)

    --need a special stream that reads from a file live, with buffering to allow some rollback without seeking all the time
    --whitespace and line comments are skipped by the stream itself
    --whitespace skipping can be paused (for lua_expressions, strings, names, numbers and other base types)

    letter ::= "a" | "b" | "c" | "d" | "e" | "f" | "g" | "h" | "i" | "j" | "k" | "l" | "m" | "n" | "o" | "p" | "q" | "r" | "s" | "t" | "u" | "v" | "w" | "x" | "y" | "z" | "A" | "B" | "C" | "D" | "E" | "F" | "G" | "H" | "I" | "J" | "K" | "L" | "M" | "N" | "O" | "P" | "Q" | "R" | "S" | "T" | "U" | "V" | "W" | "X" | "Y" | "Z"

    name_block ::= { letter | digit | "_" }+ //no whitespace allowed here

    lua_code ::= --special processing (maybe not needed): brackets are matched, strings and comments are skipped, so there can be nested expressions, hopefully no stray {} will be missed, as this would mess up the stream
    lua_expression ::= "{|" lua_code "|}"   |  
                        "${|" lua_code "|}" |  --syntactic sugar for !{return (expression)}

    label ::= "@" name ":"
    flag ::= "!" (name | lua_expression) --these flags are interpreted by the compiler directly and set things like the format of the output (8, 16 or 32 bit int, fixed point types, float, etc...)

    package ::= "package" name block

    file ::= {package | lua_expression }

the lua expression is evaluated and any of its results are taken as a strings and included in the code, separated by spaces, processing continues from where the expression was evaluated

---- the configuration objects can be packages
---- by the way, remove the zero termination in the name of the configuration objects

the compiler creates a file with the following structure:
 - table of references
    - 8 bit number of entries in the external refence table
    - for each external reference
        - 8 bit size of the name of the package
        - the package name as chars  (no zero termination)
        - 8 bit size of the name of the label inside the package - 0 represents the start of the data block
        - the label name as chars (no zero termination)
 - table of labels
    - 8 bit number of entries in the labels table
    - for each label
        - 24 bit the index of the label inside the data after linking
            - if the most significant bit is high, the label is a reference to an external reference, whose index is stored in the least significant byte
        - 8 bit size of the name of the label inside the package
        - the label name as chars
 - data
    - a series of repetitions of the following:
        - 16 bit the number of subsequent bytes that do not contain references, if 0xFFFF, the next bytes are external references, if 0x0000, the next bytes are internal references
        - either:
            - data words without references
            - a series of references (internal or external), which are
                - 8 bit for the reference number (0xFF terminates the series)
                - 16 bit for the offset in bytes after the label
                - 8 bit for how many bytes to copy. 0 means to write the 32bit pointer to the data instead

during linking, just before loading in flash, the pointer to all the references is collected
if a reference is not found, a warning is issued and a nullptr is stored instead

the linked package has the following structure:
 - 32 bit pointer to the actual data
 - table of labels
    - for each label
        - 32 bit pointer to the memory the label refers to
        - 8 bit size of the name of the label
        - the label name as chars (no zero termination)
        - padding to the next word boundary
 - data
    - the 8 bit counters are interpreted and removed
    - the references in the data are replaced with actual pointers (a 32 bit value), word alignment is user responsibility using the @@ padding directive
