    format string: { [ <count> | '\'' <name> '\'' ]<type>["[" <arraysize> | '\'' <name> '\'' "]"] }
    <count> is the number of times to repeat the field
    <name> before the type is the name of the field
    <arraysize> is the size of the array
    <name> after the type is a reference to a field set before, that contains the size of the array

    whitespace is ignored before and after a format string
    <type> can be a character (see below), a bitfield <n:n:...>, or a struct {<format> <format> ...}
    Format characters (the number after : is the default size in bits):
    x:8   pad byte (packing -> insert a 0x00; unpacking -> skip a byte)
    X:8   unsigned int in hex (see note below)
    c:8   char (packs/unpacks as string)
    b:8   signed 8 bit integer
    B:8   unsigned 8 bit integer
    ?:8   _Bool (packing -> int; unpacking -> bool)
    h:16  signed 16 bit integer (short)
    H:16  unsigned 16 bit integer (unsigned short)
    i:32  signed 32 bit integer (int)
    I:32  unsigned 32 bit integer (unsigned int)
    l:32  signed 32 bit integer (long)
    L:32  unsigned 32 bit integer (unsigned long)
    q:64  signed 64 bit integer (long long)
    Q:64  unsigned 64 bit integer (unsigned long long)
    n:32  ssize_t (same as i)
    N:32  size_t (same as I)
    f:32  float
    d:64  double
    s:8   char[] (zero terminated)
    p:8   char[] (pascal style, 8 bit for size, followed by the characters)
    P:32  void * (packing -> int; unpacking -> lightuserdata)
